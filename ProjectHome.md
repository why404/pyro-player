_“Why build yet another video player?”_ you ask.

Pyro only integrates the core logic of playing video using flash. Yea, sure, you can build your own thing using NetStream and NetConnection, hey , that’s basically what Pyro does and that’s what professionnals do. They do it over and over again.

So why waste time with all the same problems like size handling, duration, bandwidth detection, etc?

It’s from this question that Pyro was born.

Not a full fledge player like whats available out there, pyro is, plain and simple, a video player API for flash.

The only graphical aspect of pyro is, well, a video. Thats right NO buttons, NO skins, nothing but the video. All this GUI-UI stuff is left to anyone with actionscript 3 knowledge to deal with.

Pyro is lightweight, has quite a small footprint,  and holds very limited external dependencies.

Times of jerking around with netStream and netConnection related stuff, keeping up to date with new file formats, adding new callback methods to match certain types of streams, parsing seemingly good URLs for playback in different streaming servers, resizing and aligning correctly, all pretty much gone.

**Thanks Pyro !**
