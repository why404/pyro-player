<strong>Why no UI  ? Mental issues… ?</strong>

This is the question that comes up the most when peer developers hear about this project. Let me explain.

With as little experience as I have with building video players in flash, I’ve come to notice that my two main time wasters on doing such projects were:

   <li>Recoding-copy-pasting the same snippets of code for netStream, netConnection, resizing and buffering and applying it to the project.</li>
   <li>While using a third party skinnable player, figuring out how to make it behave and look exactly how I need it.</li>

With Pyro you won’t waste precious production time on tucktaping and gluing together bloated pieces of code. Nor will you spend time trying to understand someone else’s code. Pyro was coded with those two main reasons in mind at all time. The API gives you more control than you could wish for for playing videos and lets you either build your own singular skin everytime or empowers you to create your own skinnable player with whatever feature you would like.

Times of jerking around with netStream and netConnection related stuff, keeping up to date with new file formats, adding new callback methods to match certain types of streams, parsing seemingly good URLs for playback in different streaming servers, resizing and aligning correctly, all pretty much gone.  Thanks Pyro !
