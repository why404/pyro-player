<strong>Why no UI  ?</strong>

This is the question that comes up the most. Let me explain.

I’ve come to notice that my two main time wasters while integrating video in flash were:

   <li>Recoding-copy-pasting the same snippets of code for netStream, netConnection, resizing and buffering and applying it to the project.</li>
   <li>While using a third party skinnable player, figuring out how to make it behave and look exactly how I need it.</li>

With Pyro you won’t waste precious production time on tucktaping and gluing together bloated pieces of code. Nor will you spend time trying to understand someone else’s code. Pyro was coded with those two main reasons in mind at all time. The API gives you more control than you could wish for for playing videos and lets you either build your own singular skin everytime or empowers you to create your own skinnable player with whatever feature you would like.

Times of jerking around with netStream and netConnection related stuff, keeping up to date with new file formats, adding new callback methods to match certain types of streams, parsing seemingly good URLs for playback in different streaming servers, resizing and aligning correctly, all pretty much gone.  Thanks Pyro !

<strong> Can I use Pyro in Flex ? </strong><br>
Yes
<br><br><br>
<strong> Can I use Pyro as a Papervision or Away3D material.</strong><br>
Yes
<br><br><br>
<strong>How much does it weight</strong><br>
The final weight, once in a swf, for now is something close to 15 kiloBytes. 
Might be a bit less or a bit more, all depending on what Pyro related event class you'll be using in your code.

*Is there any documentation for this*<br>
Yes, the online, not finished but pretty complete, docs is online on my personal site located at:<br>
http://gronour.com/pyro/doc/html/index.html
<br>Also, you will find the documentation in the downloadable zip package and under version control.
